 * DESC     : A special trigger that plays different events depending on whether the number of
 *            collectibles the player holds passes a certain threshold. It has commands for the
 *            first time the player arrives, subsequent visits without enough collectibles, and
 *            a script to pass and delete the trigger once the player arrives with the threshold.
