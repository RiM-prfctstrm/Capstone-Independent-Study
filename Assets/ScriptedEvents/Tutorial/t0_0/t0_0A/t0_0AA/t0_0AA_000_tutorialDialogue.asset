    - dialogueText: In most of the world, it's easy to figure out where you are and
        where you're going thanks to GPS.
      nameTag: Friendly Cyclist
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: However, in cities like this, where they're building spaceships
        in orbit, the construction sites leave no room for the GPS satellites.

    - dialogueText: Instead, cartography drones called nanoblips are scattered all
        around the ground here. They look kind of like GPS icons.

      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: If you pick up nanoblips, they'll show you on your map where
        you want to go. The more you have, the more precise your navigation.

    - dialogueText: If you have a lot of them, you can even see where you are.

    - dialogueText: Just be careful, because if you crash on your bike, you'll lose
        some of them.

    - dialogueText: It's not the end of the world if that happens, though, because
        they'll eventually find their way back to where they belong.

    - dialogueText: Just go somewhere else for a while, and they'll be waiting for
        you when you get back.

    - dialogueText: Oh, and you won't lose any, while you're walking, either.

    - dialogueText: One last thing, but make sure to release them when you're done
        using them. We all have to share, after all.

    - dialogueText: And that's how nanoblips work. Thanks for listening, safe travels,
        and have fun!
