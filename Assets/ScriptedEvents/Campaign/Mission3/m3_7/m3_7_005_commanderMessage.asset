    - dialogueText: Greetings, people of Cradle. I am Leif Armstrong, commander of
        the Small Step Extraterrestrial Settlement Preparation Mission.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: As I am recording this, it has been seven months since I have
        set foot on the planet Pearl.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: As you are watching this, it has been an additional five years.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: With how short we've been here, and how long your journey will
        be, it is certain that our conditions will change greatly by the time of
        your arrival.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: In fact, they are probably already dramatically changed by the
        time you are watching this.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: That means it is indeed risky to send you on an interstellar
        voyage on our present knowledge alone, but as I will explain, it is not as
        bad a risk as it may seem.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: First, the risk created by delaying the launch too long is greater
        than the risk created by travelling to Pearl too early.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: On this short a scale, the Sun's lifespan is unpredictable, meaning
        every day we delay is a day the planet could be engulfed when the sun becomes
        a red giant.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: The risk is also much less aboard the transport ships, which
        were designed to last for decades, since their construction predates Pearl's
        discovery.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Further, as you approach us, the information we send will arrive
        faster, meaning the risk of its inaccuracy will be reduced as time goes on.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: That reduction will not happen if you stay on Cradle.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Finally, if between now and your arrival, we do fail, and Pearl
        proves to unhabitable, it is better we learn that when only a few of us are
        there and the rest of you still have a chance to find a home somewhere else.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: With that in mind, it is much safer to begin the journey, and
        thus send this report, earlier rather than later.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Second, seven months is a far less risky timespan on Pearl than
        it is on Cradle.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: The Pearlan year is about 201 days back home, or just under 7
        months.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: By now, we have witnessed the full Pearlan year and have firsthand
        understanding of its seasonal cycle.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: We are thus less likely to experience unprecedented climatic
        difficulties here than we would be after spending the same amount of time
        on a frontier in Cradle.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: All of this is not to say that there is no risk, just that it
        is within acceptable levels.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: With that out of the way, from the knowledge we have of living
        on this planet, we believe it is the right course of action to proceed as
        scheduled and have the Giant Leap fleet head to Pearl.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: As of now, we have twelve settlements spread across the various
        biomes of Pearl.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: While some have endured more hardships than others, their crews
        are all in good shape and have good morale.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Nearly all settlements have been able to support themselves with
        only the resources available and the equipment they came with.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Not only that, but they have done so well that they have consistently
        expanded and improved their infrastructure.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: With that, the rate at which we research and explore the planet
        is increasing, and settlement life increasingly resembles life on Cradle,
        especially for civilian crew members.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: We are confident enough in our continued success that we are
        now allowing crew members to start their own families here.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Already, Eve van Houten of Settlement 3 is expecting the first
        child to be born on this planet.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Our level of success is in no small part due to our ample food
        production.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: While Cradlean crops do not fare well in the wild because of
        Pearl's shorter seasons, even the air here is rich in nutrients, so we have
        grown enough in greenhouses to keep everyone well-fed.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: On top of that, our intrepid exploration teams are compiling
        a list of native plants and animals that are edible, and narrowing it down
        to ones that are good candidates for domestication.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: "We expect to begin integrating Pearlan species into our regular
        food supply by the end of next year.\r"
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Of course, not everything has been so easy.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: This planet's abundance means that predators grow to the size
        of dinosaurs, and since they don't know us, they aren't afraid of us.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: On a similar note, many herbivore species attack us precisely
        because they are afraid of us.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: As of now, we are still trying to figure out how to teach laypeople
        to deal with the animals, and how to teach the animals to avoid us without
        resorting to mass slaughter.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Other natural disasters exist as well.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: The northern continent is prone to droughts and wildfires, and
        the southern isthmus web suffers frequent tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and
        earthquakes.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: The winds are generally stronger here than on Cradle, so storms
        are often violent.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: However, these are not reason to panic.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Hardships like these exist on Cradle too, and the strategies
        we use to handle them at home often work just as well here.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: It's not like the whole planet freezes over or the atmosphere
        spontaneously bursts into flames.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Our species has a proven track record of surviving and recovering

      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Small Step's current priorities are to expand our infrastructure

      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: The former efforts will smooth your arrival and settlement.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: The latter will prepare us to brace the planet for the introduction
        of dozens of populous alien species, so that we do not accidentally destroy
        the biosphere when you arrive.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: Hopefully, by then, we will understand the planet well enough
        and have enough of a foothold that most of you can stary your new lives here
        immediately.
      nameTag: Small Step Commander
      portrait: {fileID: 0}
    - dialogueText: As for now, we are all excited to discover more of what this
        planet has to offer, we eagerly await your arrival, and we hope you have
        a safe, happy trip.
