  _msgContents: 'Hi Mom and Dad! Hi Peps!



    Sorry it''s been so long since my
    last message. As we get farther away from Cradle, it takes more time and bandwidth
    to send data back home, so we''ve haven''t been letting us use the transmitters
    for personal messages as often. I only get to send one now because we''re letting
    everyone do it to celebrate reaching Pearl, and even then I don''t have much
    time to write since Emile and Aoi are in line behind me. Hopefully, I''ll be
    able to talk more once we set up permanent communication equipment on the planet.



    For
    now, I''m safe and I''m doing great. Nothing unexpected happened since my last
    message, and it probably would have really boring these last few months if we
    weren''t so excited about reaching Pearl. It''s like we''ve been waiting for
    Christmas, and it''s finally Christmas Eve.



    Even though we don''t know
    where we''re landing yet, Pearl looks beautiful from orbit. It''s a lot like
    Cradle, but with bigger, mostly narrower landmasses that all connect to each
    other. Instead of being surrounded by oceans, the oceans are surrounded by them.
    There''s a lot of huge lakes in the continents, so I don''t think we''ll have
    to worry about having less water.

    The most amazing thing, I think, is the
    sheer scale of it all. Back home, it would take ten days to drive across the
    country, And that''s only about a fifth of the diameter of Cradle. Pearl is a
    bit bigger than that. That''s huge! But, from where I''m sitting, it looks like
    I could walk from its North Pole to its South Pole in the same amount of time
    I could walk across a football field.  And for it to look so small, I have to
    be hundreds of thousands of kilometers (sorry, Dad) away!

    And when you look
    at more than just the planet, it gets even more unbelievable. Think of this:
    Cradle is about 92 million miles from the Sun. It takes light, the fastest thing
    there is by a huge margin, eight minutes to travel that far. Our ships go almost
    as fast as light, and it still took us five years to reach Pearl. And in all
    that time, even though space has so many absolutely huge things like the planets
    and the stars, we never saw anything that looked bigger than the twinkling stars
    you see at night at home.



    Compared to a planet, we''re too small to even
    be seen. Compared to the immenseness of space, the planets are too small to be
    seen.

    It''s mind-boggling.



    Well, I should probably get going. I''m
    already over allowance and I can feel Emile''s breath condensing on my neck.

    Hope
    I can talk again soon. I can''t wait to tell you guys what it''s like living
    on another planet.



    Love,

    Salt'
