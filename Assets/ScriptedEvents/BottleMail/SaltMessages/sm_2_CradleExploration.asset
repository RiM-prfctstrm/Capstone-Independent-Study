    Been a while, hasn''t it?
    I''ve been really busy with setting up the colony and maintaining Frames, so
    I haven''t had the time to write. We''ve done a lot since then, so here''s what
    I''ve been up to.

    

    For the first couple weeks, we remained based
    in orbit while advanced construction and defense teams cleared sites for settlement.
    I thought I''d get a break until I landed, but it turns out, if you leave a giant
    robot unused for a few years, when you boot it up, it''s gonna have problems.
    Also, since everyone is so excited to check out the planet, they''ve been a little
    reckless with their Frames, and that means more work for me. It''s not all a
    chore, though. It''s been interesting to make all the adjustments that need to
    be made to help them perform in Pearl''s Conditions. The gravity and atmosphere
    are slightly different here, and though it''s normally not enough that you''d
    notice, when you''re operating a 6-ton exosuit, it makes an impact.

    

    But,
    I''m sure you''re more excited about what it''s like living on Pearl. It''s actually
    pretty normal most of the time. Colony 10 is a bit like a medium-sized town.
    You wouldn''t know we were on another planet if it weren''t for the walls, the
    research equipment, and the grass that looks a lot more like tubes than blades.
    Mostly, I just go about my day working and living with the others in the colony,
    and it doesn''t feel all that different from being on the spaceship, except I
    can enjoy the fresh air. I guess the similarities make sense, cause even on Cradle,
    despite all the different cultures and environments, there''s still a lot of
    things that look pretty similar everywhere. The sky is blue, the plants are green,
    the roads need a little work. We all have the same basic needs, and the same
    means of fulfilling them usually work anywhere.

    The most fun on Pearl is
    when I get deployed as a field mechanic for one of the scouting missions. The
    sights are amazing and everyone''s at the top of their game. We''ve seen four-winged
    birds and glowing, carnivorous plants, savannahs where the grass pulls back when
    you come near it, and forests where the trees hold boulders in their branches.
    Those last ones are especially cool, because the lichens that grow on the boulders
    are huge and bright and colorful. They look like coral hung up in the sky.

    And
    it''s extra fun hearing all the researchers geek out over everything in sight.
    If they aren''t taking notes or pictures, they''re always talking someone''s
    ear off. But, it''s good. It''s all so interesting. Not just their theories about
    this planet, but also how it relates to the explanations for stuff back home.
    Like, did you know that insects don''t actually have brains? A few of them here
    might, but that''s different from anything back on Cradle, and we haven''t been
    able to catch any specimens of them yet. I think I''ve learned just as much about
    home as I have about here.

    We''ve had some encounters with dangerous animals
    and environments, but so far we''ve fended them off pretty well. Usually, the
    worst casualties we''ll have is someone getting food poisoning or a couple people
    coming home with a couple broken bones. Most of our success in that area has
    come to down to good safety procedures and our defense teams'' skills, but I
    can''t imagine how people trekked frontiers without modern technology. I know
    at least I''d be screwed without a jeep or our environmental database.

    

    That''s
    all from me for now. Can''t wait for you to get here so I can show you around
    the place. Especially the places I named after you. I''d rather keep them a surprise
    for when you can go there yourselves, but I know you''re gonna like them, or
    at least you''ll appreciate the thought. Hope I''ll have a chance to message
    you again soon.

    

    Love,

    Salt'
