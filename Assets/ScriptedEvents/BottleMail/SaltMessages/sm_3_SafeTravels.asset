    I don''t know whether this
    will arrive before the trip or not, but as long as you''re not blown up by the
    sun or the signal misses and drifts millions of miles away in space, I''m fine
    with it. If you haven''t left yet, I hope you''ll enjoy the journey, and if you
    have, I hope you''re already enjoying it.

    I''ve still got my own trip pretty
    fresh in my head, so let me give you a couple pointers to make the most of yours.

    


    First,
    something a bit practical. Since you''ll be getting closer to Pearl and getting
    these messages faster, you''ll probably be tempted to start sending me replies.
    I don''t think that''s a very good idea, at least not until you get really, really
    close. For one thing, I don''t know whether or how they''re letting civilians
    use the comms on the Mahayana ships, so it might be more trouble than it''s worth.
    The big issue, though, is that when you''re going nearly at the speed of light,
    your lightspeed messages aren''t going to get to us much faster. If you sent
    one away now, it would only beat you by at most two months, and the window only
    shortens from there. When the difference is only that small, there''s no way
    I''ll be able to send you timely replies, and at that point, I''d rather just
    wait to hear all your new stories in person.

    The plus side of going that
    fast, though, is that since light can''t move any faster when it''s from a moving
    source, in some of the bigger areas, you can actually see it spread across the
    room.

    


    Second, don''t wear out the cool stuff. I know finally getting
    off Cradle and getting to Pearl are really exciting, but even with all the cool
    new stuff you get to see and do on a spaceship, it''s going to get stale. Even
    in a ship the size of a country, there''s only so much they can fit, and the
    views are pretty much the same the whole way: stars streaking by too fast to
    ever look distinct. Don''t get me wrong, it''s a sight to behold, but if all
    you do is behold it, it''ll stop being special. Since this is something you''ll
    only get to see at this point in your life, you want to keep it special.

    So,
    as boring as it sounds, I want you to mostly keep treating life normally while
    you''re on the spaceship. Spend time with each other, make friends with your
    new neighbors, and whatever you do put your hearts into it, no matter how mundane
    it is. Don''t put life on hold until you get to Pearl, either. A lot will happen
    in five years, and you''d miss most of it if you don''t grab it while you can.
    If you can find joy in the ordinary things, even if you exhaust all the specialness
    of interplanetary travel, you''ll still have a great trip.

    


    And
    even if you do get bored of the trip, don''t worry, I''ll do my best to make
    sure you''ve always got something good to look forward to. Once you''re on your
    way, my messages should start getting there twice as fast, so even if it''s not
    a good idea to send a lot to me, you''ll still be getting a lot more along the
    way.

    


    As always, I love you, and I can''t wait to see you again.
    Safe travels, and enjoy your last looks at Cradle.
