  _msgContents: 'Hello, pepper479, and welcome to BottleMail!


    BottleMail is
    a free, open-source interstellar communication protocol designed to preserve
    the integrity of digital information sent across the vacuum of space. Most remote
    communication is performed by encoding data into waves of light. While this works
    excellently on a terrestrial scale, on a cosmic scale, that data is vulnerable
    to degradation due to gravitational distortions, stray particles, and the far-flung
    light of other stars. A distance of one lightyear means that there is a whole
    year for that data to degrade.

    BottleMail attempts to solve this problem
    by encasing important data in a shell of dummy lightwaves that can intercept
    or cancel foreign intrusions before they can damage the contained information,
    similar to how letters could be sent across oceans by encasing them in a watertight
    bottle. BottleMail shells are designed with special patterns to protect against
    intrusions from all three directions, and to be recognized by compatible receivers
    so that the dummy information can be filtered away, even if degraded.


    If
    you are receiving this message, then you have either installed a BottleMail-capable
    receiver, or have had your request to be forwarded messages from certain BottleMail
    users your way. We hope that you will enjoy reading high-fidelity messages from 
    other worlds.


    Carrying your hopes across the stars,

    -The BottleMail
    Team
